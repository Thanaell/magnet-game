# magnet-game

The purpose of this project was to make a small game from scratch in Unity 3D, then port it to VR, and deploy it on a Oculus Quest 2. This is a twist on a roll-a-ball game, where the player uses a magnet to control the movement of metallic spheres. I manually implemented the magnetic effect using Unity forces.
